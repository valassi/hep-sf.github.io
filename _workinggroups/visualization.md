The Visualization Working Group (WG) gathers experts, develeopers, users and all people from the HEP community interested in interactive data visualization and event displays. 

The WG has been started in October 2016 and it is convened by Riccardo Maria Bianchi (*University of Pittsburgh, US*, ATLAS Experiment). 

All are welcome to join the WG and participate!

## Goal

The goal of the WG is to discover common approaches, foster collaboration among HEP experiments and groups, plan future software development and developing common tools.

## Description of the WG

Here follows the description of the WG, its challenges and the questions which it should address, as defined by the WG itself during the Visualization session in the HSF Workshop in San Diego (see link in the meetings' list below).

The first task of the WG was the writing of a [common white paper](http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/activities/cwp.html) about Visualization issues and challenges in HEP, and possible solutions, in a time scale of 5-10 years. The paper is now completed and published on arXiV: <https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.10309>.


### Scope of the WG activities

Visual representation of event data overlaid with detector geometry for the purpose of  HEP research, education and outreach. This representation can be static (event displays) or time-dependent (animations).

#### Out of scope

Visualization of detector infrastructure and systems (eg. slow control)
Visualization for statistical data analysis (histograms, etc…)

### WG Challenges

* Find common approaches, promoting common tools
* Improve support for the following use cases:
    * detector design (geometry browser)
    * simulation and reconstruction development
    * physics analysis
    * outreach & education
* Improve support for required platforms and devices
* Ensure sustainability for key software packages
* Improve low latency access to data, low entrance cost, from a visualization point of view
* Improve rendering performance

### Some open question to shape the WG activities

* Can we develop a common framework such that experiments can plug in geometry and event data in their own formats/data?
* Can the data delivery be web-based?
* Can we develop a collaborative (“multi-player”) tool to visualize and interact with event data and geometry in real time and a distributed manner (Google doc for visualization)? How will this capability advance HEP research and outreach?
* Can we have common graphics engine?
* Can we think about common visualization tools with other fields (astrophysics, geophysics, etc…)? And can we learn something from them?

### Interaction with other WGs

Topics for which we will have to interact with other WGs:

*	Data access (data  handling, frameworks)
*	Geometry description (simulation group)
