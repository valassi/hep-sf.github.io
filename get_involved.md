# How to get involved

Our goal is to make every effort going on as transparent and open as possible.
Our official communication channel is the 
[hsf-forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/hsf-forum). If you want to contact
a smaller group of HSF advocates you can get in touch with the
[HSF Coordination Team](/organization/team.html).

See the [dedicated page](/forums.html) about HSF discussions forums for 
information about how to register and the
other existing discussion forums.

## Areas for contribution

There are plenty of opportunities for you to contribute to the HSF, be it by
participation in technical discussions, by joining one of our working groups, or
by joining the HSF with your software project:

  *  Participation in HSF [working groups](/what_are_WGs.html) and [activity areas](/what_are_activities.html)
  *  Participation in [HSF events and meetings](/future-events.html)
  *  Taking advantage of the HSF by indentifying your [software project](/projects.html) with us
  *  Giving input to the [HSF Coordination Team](/organization/team.html)
  *  Contributing to this website

## Meetings, Agendas and Video-Conferences Access

See the [Events listing](/future-events.html) on this site for information on HSF meetings, workshops,
etc. 

Meetings use the [CERN Indico system](http://indico.cern.ch/category/5816/) for agenda pages. The agenda pages are generally open to the world, and no CERN account is needed. To upload material to Indico you do need to be identified CERN now allows EduGain authentication
to many of its services, if you do not have a full CERN account.

The [Vidyo](http://information-technology.web.cern.ch/services/fe/vidyo) video conferencing system is used for almost all HSF meetings and anyone can participate in the meetings from any internet-connected location. Connection information for each specific Vidyo meeting is on the corresponding Indico meeting agenda page.

## Giving input to the HSF Coordination Team

[forums](/forums.html) and mailing lists, or if you are afraid that this is not the
right place for it, feel free to contact the
